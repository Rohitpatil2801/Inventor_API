# Inventor API Hide Component Example (C#)

Welcome to the Inventor API Hide Component Example! This project demonstrates how to create a custom button in a form using the Autodesk Inventor API with C#. The button triggers the hiding of selected components from an assembly.

### Introduction
This example showcases the usage of the Autodesk Inventor API to create a custom button in a C# form. Clicking this button initiates the process of hiding selected components within an assembly, providing a valuable feature for managing visibility in complex assemblies.

### Prerequisites
- Autodesk Inventor: A working installation of Autodesk Inventor on your development machine.

- Development Environment: Use a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio, for coding in C#.

### Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

3. Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

4. Launch Autodesk Inventor and load the target assembly file.

5. Run the application.

6. The application will open a form containing the custom button.

7. Select the components within the assembly that you wish to hide.

8. Click the custom button.

9. The selected components will now be hidden within the assembly.

### Code Structure

`Program.cs`: Contains the main entry point for the application.

`AssemblyInfo.cs`: Provides general information about the assembly.

`Form1.cs`: Implements the main form with the custom button and associated event handlers.
